## Introduction

This document serves as the **complete** definition of TangoCodes's coding standards for source code in the Javaâ„¢ Programming Language.

We based our guidelines on [Google's Java Guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) <a>but we added extra guidelines that evolved based on the experience of our Software Engineers working in different Java projects.</a>
